# VALIDDATES

This is illustrative code for Steeche about how to read a table of IDs (left column) and the dates that are considered valid for them (right column) and translate it to a dictionary accompanied by a 'is_date_valid' lookup function.

Included are also some demonstration python scripts illustrating some syntax. 

demoN.py: illustration scripts for learning
valid_dates.py: proof of concept csv-to-lookupdict script

Enjoy!
